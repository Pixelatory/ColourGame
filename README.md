# ColourGame

A little colour game that I coded in my spare time because I was otherwise bored. Took me less than 2 hours of work to put together.

It's based on a game I played with friends over the weekend.


Objective:

A text of colour will display, and this text, along with the background will all be coloured.

If the text's colour is black or white, then select the colour of the background. Otherwise, select the colour of the text (which may not be what the text actually says!).
